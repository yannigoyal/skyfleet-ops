/**
 * Reviewer Lane Runner (ADR-2782 Phase 5b, #2799).
 *
 * Executes an invocation plan from `review-lane-invocation.cts`: probes the lane, spawns the binary
 * or calls the HTTP endpoint, applies the empty-output policy, and dispatches the three first-party
 * handlers D6 names. This is the module that replaces ~640 lines of hand-authored per-CLI bash.
 *
 * THREE RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES DISAPPEAR HERE, and that is a correctness win rather than a tidy-up:
 *   - `jq` — five legs needed it on PATH; it is absent on stock Windows/Git-Bash (#2589). Parsing is
 *     `JSON.parse` now.
 *   - `curl` — the three OpenAI-compatible legs shelled out to it. Node's `fetch` replaces it, and
 *     the raw response body (where an OpenAI-compatible server puts its error JSON on a 4xx/5xx
 *     while curl still exits 0) is no longer discarded by a pipe.
 *   - external `timeout` / `gtimeout` — the Antigravity leg probed for one because
 *     `--print-timeout` cannot fire before a session exists, and STOCK MACOS SHIPS NEITHER, so on a
 *     stock Mac that leg ran unbounded. `spawnSync`'s native `timeout` is always available, so D7's
 *     "skip the probe where no bounding mechanism exists" carve-out is no longer needed.
 *
 * EVERY subprocess call in this file passes `timeout` + `killSignal` + `maxBuffer`. This repo has a
 * named `DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS` class (`CONTEXT.md:772`) and an unbounded sync spawn is not a
 * slow test, it is a hung one: `--test-force-exit` cannot interrupt a synchronous call, so a frozen
 * spawn hangs the whole CI chunk to its 10-minute kill with `# fail 0` and no `not ok` (#2099).
 *
 * TOTAL. No function here throws for a lane-level failure; every one returns a typed outcome. A
 * reviewer lane that cannot run must produce a diagnosable artifact, because the ambiguity between
 * "failed" and "ran cleanly with nothing to report" IS the defect this epic closes (#2494/#2605).

 * Compare a lane's re-resolved egress destination against the one the user consented to.
 *
 * ADR-2782 D5 puts this on the invocation path deliberately. `hostConfigKey` names a key in
 * `.planning/config.json`, which is the ONE consent-bound value living outside the SHA-pinned
 * bundle: user- and CI-editable at any time, with no re-install and no integrity check. Without
 * this check a lane consented against `http://localhost:8080` could be silently redirected to a
 * remote host by an ordinary pull request touching a JSON file, and every subsequent review would
 * egress plans, requirements, research and decisions to the new destination with no re-prompt.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NOT A MISMATCH, and this is the part that must not be "hardened" later by someone who
 * reads only the rule name:
 *   - No consent record at all ⇒ ALLOW. First-party lanes (`ollama`, `lm_studio`, `llama_cpp`) ship
 *     inside the SHA-pinned distribution and are never consent-gated, so blocking on a missing
 *     record would break every existing local-model user on upgrade.
 *   - A consent record predating this feature ⇒ ALLOW. Those records were written before a host was
 *     recorded; treating the absence as a change would force spurious re-consent across every
 *     installed capability, which ADR-2782 D4 rule 5 explicitly forbids.
 *
 * Hosts are compared NORMALIZED, so a trailing slash or an explicit `:80` is not a "destination
 * change". A warning that fires on cosmetic edits is a warning users learn to dismiss.

 * `antigravity` — three layers, a two-level timeout, and a stale-response watermark.
 *
 * Layer 1 is stdout, which works on macOS/Linux/WSL. On native Windows `agy -p` silently produces
 * no stdout despite the API call succeeding (an upstream `text_drip.go` non-TTY flush bug), so
 * layer 2 reads the transcript `agy` always persists to disk. Layer 3 is a diagnostic stub.
 *
 * THE WATERMARK IS THE SUBTLE PART. Without it, layer 2 reads the last `PLANNER_RESPONSE` in the
 * transcript regardless of when it was written — including one from a PREVIOUS invocation in the
 * same workspace, silently presenting a stale review as this run's. So the transcript line count is
 * snapshotted BEFORE the spawn and only lines appended after it are considered. If the conversation
 * id changed, `agy` started a fresh session and every line is new (skip 0).
 *
 * `takeWatermark` must therefore be called before `runAntigravity`; the plan's outer timeout is the
 * external wall-clock cap that `--print-timeout` cannot provide (it cannot fire before a session
 * exists — a process can stall pre-session and outlive its own native timeout, #2073 mode 3).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — the watermark is sequential, not concurrent. `last_conversations.json` is keyed by
 * WORKSPACE, so two `/gsd:review` runs against the same repo at the same time resolve the same
 * conversation id and share one transcript. The fallback then takes "the latest DONE
 * PLANNER_RESPONSE after the watermark" with nothing to tell the two runs apart, so one run could
 * read the other's response. This cannot be closed here: `agy` exposes no per-invocation id to
 * filter on, and the transcript carries none. It is stated rather than silently tolerated because
 * the guarantee this function advertises ("never stale") holds only for sequential use, and a
 * future reader deserves to know which half is actually guaranteed.
