/**
 * Capability trust gate — ADR-1244 Phase 4 (Decision D5 + the compatibility half of D6), extended
 * by ADR-2782 Phase 3 (#2796) with a FOURTH executable-surface class: the reviewer lane.
 *
 * PURE module. It computes *what* a capability would do and *whether* policy allows it; it
 * never mutates the filesystem and never performs I/O beyond reading staged files to confirm
 * declared executable artifacts exist. The actual consent decision (yes/no) is passed in by the
 * caller — GSD has no interactive-prompt layer in lib (the runtime/CLI edge owns that), so the
 * gate stays testable and side-effect-free. See docs/explanation/capability-trust-model.md.
 *
 * LEAF MODULE — imports ONLY: node:fs, node:path, and ./semver-compare.cjs.
 *
 * ADR-2782 D5 (#2796): a `reviewer` lane is piped the plan text, requirements, research findings
 * and CONTEXT.md decisions, then its output is read back into REVIEWS.md — making it an executable
 * surface exactly like a hook, command module, or MCP server, and it is disclosed and consent-bound
 * the same way. `disclosureSignature` appends the lane element to its output ONLY when at least one
 * lane is declared (D4.5) — a lane-free manifest's signature stays byte-identical to before this
 * class existed, so no already-consented capability re-prompts on upgrade. The RESOLVED host (as
 * opposed to the declared `hostConfigKey`) is disclosed to a human but deliberately EXCLUDED from
 * the signature — the loader has no config resolver and must compute the same signature as the
 * lifecycle (constraint 2, `.gsd/phase/chore-2796-reviewer-trust-disclosure/40-design.md`).
 *
 * Exports:
 *   RESERVED_NAMESPACES               — id prefixes third parties may not claim
 *   discloseExecutableSurfaces(...)   — enumerate hooks / command modules / mcpServers / reviewer lanes
 *   collectReviewerLaneSurfaces(...)  — the reviewer-lane collector, independently testable
 *   checkReservedNamespace(id)        — is this id in a reserved namespace?
 *   evaluateSourceAllowed(parsed,...) — strictKnownRegistries enforcement
 *   checkEngines(manifest, host)      — engines.gsd hard gate + compatVersions downgrade
 *   evaluateInstallTrust(args)        — compose: source + namespace + engines + disclosure
 *   executableSetChanged(old, new)    — did the executable surface set change between versions?
 *   summarizeDisclosure(disclosure)   — human-readable consent-prompt lines
 *   UNRESOLVED_HOST_MARKER            — the non-blank marker for an unresolved openai-http host
 *   EGRESS_PAYLOAD_CLASSES            — the named data classes every reviewer lane receives

 * Enumerate every executable surface a capability manifest declares.

 *   - `hooks`:    [{ event, script }]              — scripts run as runtime hook commands
 *   - `commands`: [{ family, module, router? }]    — modules require()'d into the CLI process
 *   - `mcpServers`: { <name>: {...} } | [{ name }] — servers spawned by the host runtime
 *   - `reviewer`: { slug, transport, invoke, ... }  — an external reviewer lane (ADR-2782 D5, #2796)
 *
 * `mcpServers` is not a first-party capability.json field today, but a third-party manifest may
 * declare it, so the trust gate discloses it whenever present (honest disclosure over the
 * narrower first-party schema). Pure: when `stagedDir` is provided, declared hook/command-module
 * files are existence-checked and any missing ones reported, but nothing is mutated. A reviewer
 * lane's `binary` is NEVER existence-checked against `stagedDir` (matrix C6) — like an MCP server's
 * command, it is a PATH lookup on the user's machine, never a bundle artifact; existence-checking it
 * would block every lane install.
 *
 * TOTAL: never throws, for any manifest shape — including a non-object manifest, a Proxy with
 * throwing traps, or a property with a throwing getter (matrix C5, E2). Disclosure runs BEFORE
 * Phase 2's validation, on a manifest validation would reject outright, so it must tolerate what
 * validation does not. Each surface class is collected independently (`safeCollect`) so a hostile
 * value in ONE class degrades only that class to empty rather than losing the other three.
 *
 * `resolveHost` (optional, #2796) is forwarded to `collectReviewerLaneSurfaces` so a caller with
 * config access (the lifecycle, never the loader — see `signatureForManifest`) can disclose the REAL
 * destination of an `openai-http` lane. It never affects the returned signature.

 * receives identical argv either way.
 *
 * Recorded here rather than only in the PR that found it: reachability rests entirely on the ingest
 * path staying `JSON.parse`-only. Anyone who adds a loader that builds a manifest by other means
